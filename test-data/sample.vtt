00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Welcome everyone to today's discussion about artificial intelligence.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for having me. I'm excited to talk about machine learning applications.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with the basics. What are neural networks?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
<v Speaker 2>Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Speaker 1>And how do they relate to deep learning?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Deep learning is essentially neural networks with multiple layers.
