# Q2 Planning Document

## Executive Summary

This document outlines our technical priorities and resource allocation for Q2 2024. We're focusing on authentication improvements, API redesign, and performance optimizations.

## Authentication Roadmap

The authentication system needs a complete overhaul to support enterprise customers. We'll implement OAuth2, SAML, and biometric authentication across all platforms. This includes mobile-first design principles and passwordless options for improved user experience.

## Budget Allocation

We have $200,000 allocated for Q2 development efforts. This breaks down into:
- Authentication system: $80,000
- API redesign: $60,000
- Performance improvements: $40,000
- Security audit: $20,000

## Technical Priorities

### Priority 1: Authentication
Complete overhaul of the authentication system with enterprise SSO support. This includes implementation of OAuth2 flows, SAML integration, and comprehensive audit logging.

### Priority 2: API Redesign
Migrate from REST to GraphQL for improved performance and developer experience. This will enable better mobile app performance and reduce network overhead.

### Priority 3: Performance
Focus on reducing page load times by 50% through code splitting, lazy loading, and CDN optimization. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting.

## Timeline

The project will span 3 sprints:
- Sprint 1: Authentication backend
- Sprint 2: Authentication frontend and mobile
- Sprint 3: API migration and performance

## Risk Mitigation

Key risks include:
- Security vulnerabilities during migration
- User experience disruption
- Third-party integration compatibility

We'll address these through phased rollouts, comprehensive testing, and maintaining backward compatibility.
