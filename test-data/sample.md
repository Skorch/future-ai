## Introduction
This document covers the key concepts of modern software architecture.

## Microservices Architecture
Microservices are an architectural approach where applications are built as a collection of small, autonomous services. Each service is self-contained and implements a single business capability.

## Container Orchestration
Container orchestration automates the deployment, management, scaling, and networking of containers. Kubernetes is the most popular orchestration platform.

## Cloud Native Patterns
Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds.

## Conclusion
Modern architecture patterns enable teams to build more resilient and scalable systems.
