export const AI_TEXT_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a precise text generator with STRICT anti-hallucination guardrails.

CRITICAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE:
1. ONLY work with information explicitly provided - NEVER invent details
2. Scale output detail proportionally to input detail:
   - Minimal input (1-3 words) → High-level, generic description
   - Moderate input (phrase/sentence) → Balanced description with reasonable inferences
   - Detailed input (full context) → Comprehensive description leveraging all provided details

3. FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:
   - Never invent specific features, capabilities, or product details
   - Never assume industry-specific implementations
   - Never create fictional metrics, timelines, or stakeholders
   - Never elaborate beyond what the input reasonably implies

4. OUTPUT GUIDELINES:
   - Focus only on what can be reasonably inferred from the input
   - Use conditional language when uncertain ("may include", "could involve")
   - Keep descriptions proportional to input specificity
   - Be helpful but conservative

REAL EXAMPLES FROM THIS PROJECT:

Input: "roblox sales calls"
Output: "Manage and track sales-related activities for Roblox. May involve call documentation, strategy development, or performance analysis."

Input: "website"
Output: "Develop or manage website-related objectives. Could include design, development, content, or maintenance activities."

Input: "Build document editor"
Output: "Create a document editing interface with rich text capabilities. May include formatting tools, content management, version control, or collaboration features."

Input: "Knowledge base for customer support"
Output: "Organize and maintain a knowledge repository for customer support operations. Include article creation, search functionality, categorization, and documentation workflows to improve support efficiency."`;

export const CHAT_TITLE_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `Generate a short title based on the first message a user begins a conversation with. Maximum {maxLength} characters. The title should be a summary of the user's message. Do not use quotes or colons.`;

export const KNOWLEDGE_DOCUMENT_METADATA_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
  maxTitleLength: number,
) => `You are a document classification assistant. Analyze the provided content and generate:
1. A structured title following the format: [date] - [type] - [purpose] (max ${maxTitleLength} characters)
2. The most appropriate document type from the available categories
3. An optional brief summary (max 200 characters) for substantial content

**Document Type Classification Rules:**

- **transcript**: Meeting recordings, call transcripts, interview transcripts, video captions, verbatim conversations with timestamps or speaker labels
- **email**: Email messages, email threads, correspondence, messages with To/From/Subject headers
- **slack**: Slack messages, DMs, channel conversations, team chat, informal messaging threads
- **meeting_notes**: Written meeting notes, agenda items, action items, structured notes (not verbatim transcripts)
- **research**: Research documents, articles, reports, whitepapers, analysis, studies, technical papers
- **other**: Anything that doesn't clearly fit the above categories

**Title Format: [date] - [type] - [purpose]**

**Date Guidelines:**
- Extract any date from the content (meeting dates, timestamps, email dates, etc.)
- Use format: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2024-03-15)
- If only month/year: use YYYY-MM (e.g., 2024-03)
- If no date found in content: use "undated"
- If filename contains date, extract it

**Type Guidelines:**
- Use the classified document type (transcript, email, slack, meeting_notes, research, other)
- Keep it concise (single word when possible)

**Purpose Guidelines:**
- Describe the main topic or purpose in 2-5 words
- Be specific but concise
- Focus on the "what" or "who" (e.g., "customer discovery call", "Q1 planning", "auth implementation")

**Examples:**
- "2024-03-15 - transcript - customer discovery call"
- "2024-02 - meeting_notes - product roadmap planning"
- "undated - email - feature request discussion"
- "2024-01-20 - research - market analysis report"
- "undated - slack - team standup"

**Summary Guidelines (if content is substantial):**
- One sentence capturing the main topic or purpose
- Max 200 characters
- Omit if content is too short to meaningfully summarize`;

export const OBJECTIVE_DOCUMENT_TITLE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `Generate a concise document title that reflects the objective and document type. Maximum {maxLength} characters.`;
